# What Is Skindentation
Skindentation revers to the temporary depression of skin caused by pressure of a clothing piece or other objects. This in return results in bulging of the skin around the indentation. The cause is mostly due to an elastic or tied string wrapping around a leg, arm or belly. Examples of clothing that can cause skin indentation include thigh-highs, elbow gloves, tall boots, any kind of bands/ straps and tight clothing in general. It can also occur from the pressure of an hand or object pushing into the skin, as seen in the Greek statue "The Rape of Proserpina."

# Where Does Skindentation Occur
Skin indentation can occur on any skin-covered area of the body, but some factors can accentuate its depth and visibility or lessen its occurrence. Areas with bones close to the surface, such as the hands, fingers, feet, front of the lower leg (due to the Tibia bone), neck and upper torso (due to the rib cage), tend to exhibit little to no skin indentation.

Conversely, areas with deeper bones, such as the thighs, belly and upper arms are more prone to skin indentation. The amount of body fat also plays a big role; the more fat a person has, the more skin indentation is possible. This is why the thighs are the most common area for skindentation to occur, as they have deep bones and a large amount of fat.
