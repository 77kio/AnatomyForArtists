# Overview

# About Fat Regions
The female an male have quite different fat regions. Generally characters with more muscles will have less fat, however even strong females will still have allot of fat comparatively to males who can almost entirely burn fat. This partially has to do with, that female bodies try to prepare for child bearing. 

The female **fat regions** are as follows:

- [Breasts](#Breasts)
- [Abdominal](#Abdominal)
- [Pelvic Region](#Pelvic-Region)
     - [Love Handles](#Love-Handles)
     - [But/ Outer Thigh](#But-Outer-Thigh)
     - [Inner thigh](#Inner-Thigh)
     - [Pubic](#Pubic)
- [Leg](#Leg)
     - [Knee](#Knee)
     - [Behind knee](#Behind-Knee)

# How to properly make use of fat regions
Clothing, rope/ chains and other things that interact with the body will act differently when touching muscly, bony or normal areas vs areas rich in fat.



# Breasts
The breasts lay on top of the pectoralis mayor and are visibly "one" with them.
